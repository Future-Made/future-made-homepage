    "text": "It is giving a time period to the producers/creators of things, services, and experiences to show an intention for a future purchase for whatever they do or might offer. As part of the demand-aware framework, in the first app, we are aiming to give a mental and financial relief to artists, by enabling their events and performances being able to be effectively demanded without requiring them to organize, ticket out or try promoting it with conventional methods beforehand, that are found too deterministic and risk-taking. That just made sense to use the lockdown period to collect demand for online and on-site concerts of the future. Hence, participation from their audiences on imagining their future events for some months and years, relatively being an online or on-site event."
